# Requierments Engineering - SolarPrototype

##### Year 1, Quartile 3 project



This project was made as part of us learning to talk to the client and complete their vision for the project.

We were tasked to create from scrapt a program to help the client estimate the cost and number of panels needed to create an instalation for their client. It was only meant to be a proof of Concept, which would allow us to show the client what could the full software look like.



It was a collaborative project between Jan Zab≈Çocki (me) and Kamila Nikitina



Original git tracking was lost due to the project being hosted on universities github and being removed after a year.

(Below is the original README.md contents)



Technologies used: Java, JavaFX
